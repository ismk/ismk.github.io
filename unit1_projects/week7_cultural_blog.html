            <p>Most of my values haven't changed that much since starting phase 0, i still believe in being persistent and to work hard for what you want. There are no shortcuts.</p>

            <p>I believe everyone should be judged on their ability and not on their race, looks or their views, just because someone looks different than you doesn't mean you have to be afraid of that person or to look down upon him, It is important to consider that he might something to contribute too, it is important to be empathetic of others, and try to understand what they would be going through.</p>

            <p>When i was growing up, the thinking of my fellow peers was that if a person was to teach someone else what they know they would lose their edge, and since the competition was so cut throat that everyone kept undercutting each other to come out on top, I never did so well in those situations, I didn't understand why someone had to lower themselves to such a level where you wouldn't be able to help someone in need.</p>

            <p>Not to help anyone else but themselves, not only fosters bad relationships but is also a very grim view on life, and its sad to realize a person could be so selfish that they would only look out for themselves, I consider that by helping others and by working in a team you not only are creating healthy environment for you and others but are also bettering yourself through it, communication and sharing facilitates better results.</p>
