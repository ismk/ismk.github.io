<a href="#" id="projects">PROJECTS_</a>

#### [Project Pothole](http://project-pothole.herokuapp.com/)

<img src="/imgs/projectpothole.jpeg" class="prjimg">
[Source Code](https://github.com/ismk/chipot)

Built a platform for users to quickly look and report potholes to the City of Chicago, data about city potholes are pulled in real-time using Open Data of Chicago and various API’s, The project was built as to provide a fast User Experience for optimum feedback from the residents of Chicago, Application was built on Ruby on Rails as backend and AngularJS, AJAX and jQuery on the front with additional statistics and graph built on D3js

After working together to get up the site running with google map integration my primarily role on this project shifted to parse and scrape the data from the City of Chicago API and make it accessible to the client from the server, I also took up the charge to optimize page load times and callback functions for the data, achieved those results using Dalli Cache and making the data JSON friendly

#### [Historical Wiki](http://historic-wiki.herokuapp.com/)

<img src="/imgs/historicwiki.jpeg" class="prjimg">
[Source Code](https://github.com/ismk/Historical_Wiki)

Created a site where users could create posts focused on historical events, which would visually represented on a timeline. Application was built on Ruby on Rails with AJAX, jQuery on the frontend and the timeline was created with D3js

Subsequently after getting the basic rails skeleton up and running, I implemented technologies like Mechanize and Nokogiri to parse and scrape data from the web (specifically wikipedia) and add it to our database
